*** IMPORTANT ***
-----------------

NEED THOROUGH TESTING OF SRAM 32 STUFF!!!

- cloning/cleaning needs looking at. If you put 4 empty patterns in a chain, clean command thinks they're free
  but they aren't removed from chain so it becomes a problem.

When organising SRAM banks, don't forget that _FLAGS need to go with their respective objects.
Means that 128 Patterns won't fit in one 8K bank so need to be 127 or 126 max (125?)

- Make Bxx into Vibrato command (change all text: manual, screen, hint boxes etc.)
  Then Vxx will be used for Volume command later

GENERAL
-------
DONE - Update manual with mute and solo stuff
DONE - Keys could do with a rethink. Not very nice to use on a control pad.

DONE - Implement new key scheme using B as modifier for navigating editor pages

DONE - Implemet Smart Transpose in Song and Chain?

DONE - Make RIGHT nav go to Instrument/Drumkit page from note column in Patterns

Player
-------
DONE - improve random range stuff
- change slide code to compare actual lo/hi byte values of destination note instead of offset
- playing pattern/chain needs to handle transpose
DONE - make echo work properly and on A, B & D
DONE - remaining commands

DONE - pre-listen notes when song is stopped need work - sound gets cutoff and transpose problems
DONE - do re-trigger command
DONE - handle bitwise value for Nxx
DONE - Speed Table needs proper implementation
DONE - Add remaining Commands
DONE - Add second command handling in Table
DONE - Add Vibrato
DONE - Add Pitch Slide
DONE - Add handling of smooth sliding/vibrato
DONE - Add Track E / DPCM
DONE - Play notes on entry needs thinking about and implementing in Editor too
DONE - have separate handler stub for pattern/table commands - need table of "allow" flags for each
DONE - need way to quit table - maybe JFF?
DONE - implement table stuff for DPCM
DONE - speed table changing stuff isn't working

Editor
------
DONE - need to shuffle stuff around to properly accommodate page title

DONE - Check copy and paste for FX Tables (need to add "FX " to copy buffer name stuff)

DONE - Change Pattern and Table screens FXx is now CM
DONE - Update hint box text for command Fxx
DONE - update Context Navigation stuff in manual for Fxx command.

DONE - need to clear RAM copy of drumkit with something useful
DONE! - add note preview to Drukmit editor?
DONE - Create 8K SRAM version (currently only SRAM map is handled, not NVRAM handling/iNES header)

DONE - do markers for;
  DONE Drumkit - put triangle on note as it plays
  DONE Duty - triangle follow table index

DONE - proper start/stop handling
DONE!!! - split editor over two banks!?
  main loop in fixed bank, array of bank numbers for each mode, set bank before jmp (xxxx)
  need to duplicate certain routines in each bank - phex stuff etc.

- add copy/paste
  DONE - chains
  DONE - patterns
  DONE - instrument (whole instrument)
  DONE - drumkit
  DONE - table
  DONE - duty
  DONE - speed

DONE - copy buffer status
DONE - error message when trying to paste incompatible data
DONE - start Setup Menu (need Song Purge first of all)
DONE - mute/solo

DONE - insert/delete steps in
  DONE - song
  DONE - chain
  DONE - pattern
  DONE - table
  DONE - duty table
  DONE - speed table
  
DONE - Try having cursor steady when moving around and only flashing when modifying value
DONE - Context jumps for commands
DONE (need display)- SELECT+B + LR = change track, need to display track number/name too
DONE - Add editBuffer method from Song Edit to all HOLD_A methods in each editor
DONE - Finish off playback cursors
DONE NEEDS TEST - handle commands that are not valid on particular tracks
DONE - display pulse waveform in duty table command
DONE - display pattern notes 1 octave down if current editing track is C

Misc
----
- RLE name-tables?

BUGS!
-----
DONE - DPCM - stopping song leaves channel clicking
DONE - VU - soloed channel doesn't show on VU meter
Table arpeggio + downwards sweep gets pitch out of whack!
DONE - Player - tie notes need old freq resetting (hi and lo)
Player - putting a slide on a step with no note produces odd results (but sort of correct!)
Player/Editor - sometimes get weird note when inserting/deleting row
DONE - Player - table and (at least) vibrato are cut off on a blank cell
Editor : changing editor track should redraw editor always
DONE - Player : sometimes tables stop working!
DONE - Player/Editor : something is corrupting SRAM - sometimes drum patterns get messed up
